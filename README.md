# Purpose-Driven Routine Builder

A calm, anti-hustle web app that helps you build sustainable daily routines—either with AI guidance or manually from scratch.

**Philosophy**: We don't give motivation. We help users build rhythm.

## 📖 How to Use

### Option A: AI-Powered Routine Creation

1. Click **"Let AI help me create a routine"** on home page
2. Answer 12 questions about:
   - **What matters**: Primary focus + other development areas + skills
   - **Time & Energy**: Available time, peak energy hours, energy pattern
   - **Obstacles**: What derails you, consistency pattern
   - **Structure**: Preferred routine structure, learning style
   - **Motivation**: Why now, 30-day goal
3. AI generates a personalized routine with time blocks for all your focus areas
4. Routine is saved as active template
5. Go to **Today** page to start your day

### Option B: Manual Routine Builder

1. Click **"I'll build mine manually"** on home page (or Settings → Build Manual Template)
2. Name your routine (e.g., "My Balanced Day")
3. Add activities one by one:
   - **Title**: What you'll do (e.g., "Web development", "Music practice")
   - **Weight**: Importance/difficulty (0.5 = light, 1 = normal, 1.5+ = important)
   - **Start Time**: When to start (24-hour format, converts to 12-hour display)
   - **End Time**: When to finish
4. Click **"Add Activity"** for each item
5. Click **"Save & Activate Template"**
6. You're taken to **Today** page with your routine ready

### Using the Today Page

**View Routines**:
- Activities sorted by start time (morning → day → evening)
- Shows time range in 12-hour format (e.g., "6:00 AM - 6:30 AM")
- Shows weight (importance) and any custom time

**Manage Routines**:
- **Mark done**: Click button to check off completed activities
- **Edit**: Modify title, weight, or time slots
- **Delete**: Remove an activity (can't undo)
- **Add**: Add a new activity on-the-fly with custom times
- **Recreate**: Reload today's routine from active template

**Track Progress**:
- Daily Score card shows discipline rating (% completed)
- Broken down as: Achieved Points / Total Possible Points

### Calendar View

- See which days have routines (filled cells)
- Click any day to see full routine details
- View completion status for past days
- Shows time ranges and weights

### Analytics Page

- **Weekly Summary**: 
  - Total activities this week

## 🏗️ Architecture & How It Works

### Data Model

The app uses these main entity types:

1. **RoutineTemplate** (Template)
   - Reusable template with multiple activities
   - Marked as `createdByAI` or manual
   - One template can be `isActive` at a time
   - Contains many `DayRoutineTemplateItem`s

2. **DayRoutineTemplateItem** (Template Activity)
   - Individual activity in a template
   - Has: title, description, category, defaultWeight
   - Has time fields: `customStartTime`, `customEndTime` (24-hour format)
   - Has `orderIndex` for ordering
   - Optional: `recommendedTime` (e.g., "30 min")

3. **CalendarDay** (Daily Instance)
   - One per day
   - Links to a template to copy activities from
   - Contains many `DayRoutineInstance`s

4. **DayRoutineInstance** (Daily Activity)
   - Individual activity for a specific day
   - Can override template values: title, weight, times
   - Links to a `DayRoutineCheck` for completion tracking
   - Can be marked as `isSkipped`

5. **DayRoutineCheck** (Completion)
   - Tracks if an activity was completed
   - Records completion time
   - Optional: effort rating, user notes

### Key Flows

**Creating a Template from AI**:
1. User answers 12 onboarding questions
2. POST `/api/ai/onboard` with answers
3. OpenAI generates routine JSON (7-9 items)
4. Time slots calculated: morning (6am+), day (9am+), evening (8pm+)
5. Template + items saved to database
6. Template activated automatically
7. Redirect to Today page

**Creating a Manual Template**:
1. User adds activities on `/manual` page
2. POST `/api/templates/manual` with activities
3. Template created with all items
4. Template activated automatically
5. Redirect to Today page

**Creating Today's Routine**:
1. User visits `/today` page
2. Check if CalendarDay exists for today
3. If not, or if "Recreate" clicked:
   - POST `/api/calendar/create-today`
   - Copy all template items as instances
   - Calculate time slots for each instance
   - Return today's routine
4. Display instances sorted by `customStartTime`

**Daily Management**:
- **Mark Done**: POST `/api/checks/toggle` → calculate daily score
- **Edit Activity**: PATCH `/api/calendar/instances/{id}` → update title/weight/times
- **Delete Activity**: DELETE `/api/calendar/instances/{id}`
- **Add Activity**: POST `/api/calendar/instances` → creates new instance
- **Fetch Today**: GET `/api/calendar/today` → returns CalendarDay with instances

### Time Handling

**Time Storage**: 24-hour format (HH:MM), e.g., "06:00", "14:30"

**Time Display**: 12-hour format with AM/PM
```typescript
const formatTime12h = (time?: string) => {
  if (!time) return ''
  const [hStr, mStr] = time.split(':')
  const h = parseInt(hStr, 10)
  const period = h >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM'
  const hour12 = h % 12 === 0 ? 12 : h % 12
  return `${hour12}:${String(m).padStart(2, '0')} ${period}`
}
// "06:00" → "6:00 AM"
// "14:30" → "2:30 PM"
```

**Time Calculation** (AI routines):
- Morning items start at 6:00 AM (360 minutes)
- Day items start at 9:00 AM (540 minutes)
- Evening items start at 8:00 PM (1200 minutes)
- 5-minute buffer between activities
- End time calculated from start + duration

## 🤖 AI Integration

### How AI Routine Generation Works

**The Prompt Strategy**:
1. **Centers on primary focus**: Gets best time slot and most weight
2. **Includes all areas**: Each focus area gets its own activity block
3. **Matches energy**: Places demanding work during peak energy time
4. **Accounts for obstacles**: Adds buffers and flexibility
5. **Respects constraints**: Doesn't overschedule

**AI Response Format** (JSON):
```json
{
  "coreTheme": "Building Web development, Leadership, Music",
  "anchorHabits": ["Web development", "Leadership", "Music", "Reflection"],
  "dailyRoutine": {
    "morning": [...],
    "day": [...],
    "evening": [...]
  },
  "weeklyNotes": "Start small. Build rhythm. Adjust as you grow."
}
```

**Fallback Routine** (When quota exceeded):
- Automatically generates basic routine from your answers
- Includes all focus areas
- Uses default times
- No API call needed

- Use fallback routine (no API needed)
- Use manual builder

### Times not displaying
- Verify `customStartTime` fields exist in DB
- Run `npx prisma db push`
- Check time format is HH:MM

### Routines not showing
